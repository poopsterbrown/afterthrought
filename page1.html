                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In Superman's Fortress of Solitude, Clark Kent is able to talk to his deceased Dad. It's not really his father, but rather a hologram that looks, sounds, and responds like him, because his father's consciousness is downloaded into the computer that the hologram operates off of. Superman is well aware it's not really his Dad, but it still brings him comfort, and is occasionally both helpful and inspiring as his "dad" is able to give him words of encouragement and advice. Afterthought is a longways off from a Kryptonian consciousness program; however,&nbsp; it's striving to get as close to that realization as possible.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a service to help you create a collection of your thoughts, memories, stories, and opinions; making up an archive of your life, by carefully organizing and categorizing your content in an easy to navigate interface.&nbsp;<br><br>Imagine that you lost someone very close to you, perhaps your parents or a best friend, and after you had some time to grieve you found out that they made an Afterthought. You could see them, hear their voice, relive memories, and even discover a side of their life that you didn't even know existed. They could recommend movies, playlists, and even give you general advice or perspectives making this the ultimate keepsake! Now imagine how your kids, friends, and family would feel if you made one for them.&nbsp;<br><br>Afterthought is consistently evolving, and trying new ideas to make this as an immersive experience as possible for your friends, family, acquaintances, and even enemies. A free option is available to implement a unique login system so that you are able to identify who is viewing your Afterthought, and controlling which content they are able to view, and dictating which sections they are able to navigate to.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Afterthought end goal is to preserve the thoughts, memories, stories, and opinions of your entire life; all in a place where you get to be the librarian to all of your own content. This is a program that is stored on a portable hard drive can be used by any Windows computer. No installation is required.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
